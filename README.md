# CivicUnion Volunteering App

An open-source app to connect potential volunteers to volunteering opportunities they'll love! Pulling from multiple databases and thousands of opportunities, the CivicUnion app 
allows users to find personalized volunteering opportunities online or near them and apply. With a CivicUnion account, users can also add opportunities to show them on their home page. 

Though not currently available on the Play Store or Apple App Store, that is the end goal (planned in a few months). 

Roadmap:
- [ ] Search filters (WIP)
- [ ] Notifications/Reminders
- [ ] Sign Up/In With Google, Apple
- [ ] Users adding opportunities (WIP)
- [ ] App Store/Play Store release (WIP)
